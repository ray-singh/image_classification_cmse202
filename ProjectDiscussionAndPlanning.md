# 1. What form of communication will work best for all of your when you need to discuss your project and make decisions?  For example, will you use Slack, Discord, text messages, email, in-person meetings etc.?

### We will use a combination of meeting after class in person, texting in a group chat we have created and emailing eachother to discuss our project progress.

# 2. How often do you think you should meet as a group to discuss your project? How long should these meetings be? What should you do if you can't make a meeting?

### We will meet after each class ends until the project deadline for maybe 30 minutes to an hour based on our needs. If one of cannot make the meeting, then they can mention what they are working on in the project and an progress they make as they go along so everyone is kept in the loop or a zoom option is also available.

# 3. What are some strategies you can use to make sure everyone is contributing to the project? How will you make sure everyone is on the same page? How will you hold each other accountable?

### Some strategies we can use is to delegate and be honest when one person cannot do something they thought they could or they need help because the task was taking longer than expected.

# 4. As a group, what are you overall goals for the project? What strategies will you use to make sure you meet these goals?

### Our overall goal is to collaborate and work on a new project we care about, and come out in the end with an algorithm or code where we know what it is doing and can explain it to others. Also to help in cancer classification research.

# Someone to be in charge of sending our reminders for group meetings and reserving a space to meet or setting up a zoom room: Calvin

# Someone to periodically test your project code to ensure that it is still working as intended and reporting issues as they arise (GitHub has an issue tracking feature!): Ray, Calvin, Keertana 

# Someone to take the lead in developing the project presentation slides (e.g. setting up a shared slide deck, building an outline, indicating who is responsible for which part, etc.): Keertana

# Record at least three short-term project goals with target deadlines in the markdown cell below.

### Nov 7: Have an initial model build to classify the images
### Nov 12: Near finished model + slideshow complete
### Nov 14: Finishing edits to the model and slideshow + submission 

# Finally, before moving on to set up your project repository, set a day, time, and (if possible) as location for your first group project meeting (you can always just use Zoom for this).

### We will have our first meeting on November 5, 2024 after class.
